# Sitecore Grid Demo #

This is a demo for the Sitecore CMS that demonstrates a grid in the content tree. The GridComponent class is the most important piece and is located at GridDemo.Web.UI.GridComponent. 

There are two solutions within this demo, one that contains a TDS project that can be used to deploy items necessary for the grid, and one that only has the Web project. 

Sitecore update packages are located in the package folder in and can be installed by using the Update Installation Wizard located at /sitecore/admin/UpdateInstallationWizard.aspx. This update package was generated via TDS and can be installed on any Sitecore instance even without having TDS installed.

The demo has been tested against Sitecore 6.4.1 rev110324 and is set to compile with .NET 4.0. 

TDS has been configured to deploy files into C:\inetpub\wwwroot\Dreamcore2011\Website.
